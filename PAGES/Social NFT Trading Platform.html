                    The first version of the Funge platform was launched on Android at the MVP stage as a mere NFT market place for buying and selling of NFTs. However there was need to further expand on the scope of the solution based on increased user needs which were gathered from research and user feedbacks. Other than having just a market place, the client wanted to create a more engaging experience between buyers and sellers on the platform while keeping the UX simple enough for any level of user.

                    <li>
                        I conducted a preliminary assessment of the existing user interface within the application, focusing on a comprehensive review of various visual elements. This evaluation encompassed an examination of aspects such as color schemes, design systems, alignment, hierarchy, typography, and page readability, among others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the application's functionality, systematically testing various features by attempting to execute a range of tasks. This examination allowed me to discern areas of effectiveness, identify areas requiring enhancement, and pinpoint aspects that exhibited complete non-functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of my primary focal points was the assessment of accessibility, with a particular emphasis on ensuring compliance with global accessibility standards for the Funge app. Given that I was also tasked with a comprehensive visual overhaul, I meticulously documented any instances where the application fell short of these accessibility guidelines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As I navigated through the app's user experience, I dedicated myself to meticulously mapping out the pre-existing user flows. Concurrently, I took particular care to delineate elements of the application that appeared to introduce complexity into the user experience.

                        <li>
                            Users also complained about the search feature being really bad, and it was really hard to find NFT collections unless you have a direct link to it.

                        <li>

                        Having direct insights from Funge community members played a pivotal role in shaping the bedrock of our primary research efforts. Guided by the principles of User-Centered Design, we delved deep into uncovering user pain points. Through our primary research, we gained valuable insights into the early users' experiences with the MVP and gained a sense of their initial expectations.

                    Once I had acquired a comprehensive understanding of our user base and their specific needs, it became imperative to establish strategic pathways for the generation of potential solutions. In this regard, I took the initiative to lead a live brainstorming session using the Miro platform, which included active participation from all team members, including stakeholders and our engineering team. Some of the key touch points addressed during this collaborative session included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We analysed the research data, sorted out user painpoints and mapped out solutions. Even though we were able to address every painpoint specifically there were some that were heavily dependent on the financial market index and existing conventions and as such it was extremly difficult to establish full control over.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We discussed on the Polygon blockchain and defined flows for new features accordingly. We also did an overhaul of the existing features end to end and we were able to restructure the flows.

                    <li>
                        We had some live sketching rounds and I was able to gather different perspetives and suggestions from other team members.

                    <li>
                        I also led a live moodboarding session on MIRO where every team member contributed to the visual experience.

                    To commence this phase of the design, my initial step involved accessing and conducting a thorough audit of the existing brand UI kits. This in-depth examination of the pre-existing brand kits, undertaken with a focus on scalability, enabled me to enact a comprehensive restructuring of the design system. My primary goal was to reinstate a high level of design consistency by crafting reusable brand components and assets, encompassing elements like typography, color palettes, icons, and grid systems, among others

                    I value simplicity, focus and utility. I aspire to make people happy by designing experiences that just get out of the way. Working on this project was such a huge eye opener for me. I'd like to say that meeting user needs is one of the bases of a successful product. While designing the funge application, every approach was centered around making the users comfortable throughout the experience and in finding this grounds, I was able to align this to the business goals.
