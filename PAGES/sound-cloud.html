                    SoundCloud introduces an innovative music listening experience tailored specifically for Iranian users.

                <p class="bottom-spacing">
                    As the company expanded, the need for a comprehensive app redesign became evident. Initially, all primary actions were conveniently accessible through the hamburger menu. However, with the growth and evolution of the company, it became imperative to restructure the app, thereby defining a new, more efficient framework for its functionality and user experience.

                <span class="span-heading">The Goal</span>
                <p class="bottom-spacing">
                    We embarked on the development of a mobile music application with the primary objective of providing users with a seamless and user-friendly platform for discovering, searching, and listening to music playlists. Our focus was on crafting an interface that not only offered a clean and aesthetically pleasing design but also facilitated effortless user interactions, ensuring an enjoyable music listening experience.

                    I was the Product Designer for this project, I collaborated with front end developers a project manager and other stake holders to design this product and I advocated strongly for a more user centric direction to the redesign.

                    My approach to problem-solving is inherently flexible and tailored to the unique requirements of each project. It is shaped by a myriad of factors, including project objectives, business imperatives, problem complexity, time constraints, and various other considerations. Below, I will outline the specific process I employed to address this particular challenge.

                    Prior to initiating the ideation phase, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the existing design, carefully examining each page to gain a deep understanding of the product's core elements. Furthermore, I conducted a thorough assessment of user feedback and comments within the app store ecosystem. This multi-pronged approach allowed me to discern not only the strengths but also the pain points associated with the current design, providing valuable insights for the project.

                    From the discoveries, I proposed a few solutions around solving the user problems and they were;

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the design more accessible by exposing key and significant sections to the user. </li>
                    <li>Introduce a modern feel and an elegant colour palette that induces a feel of relaxation.</li>
                    <li>Personalise the home screen according to the users interaction with the application. For instance,, Introduce sections like: Recently Released Songs, Popular Songs/Artists, Recommended Artist/Songs etc.</li>
                    <li>Restructure the Navigation and transition should be easily understandable, The primary aim was to reduce the number of clicks </li>

                    Simplicity is a cornerstone of strength. As designers, we are frequently enticed by eye-catching, cutting-edge, and unconventional designs. However, it is imperative to remain anchored in the 'why.' Our foremost objective is to comprehend the user, their challenges, and subsequently devise a design solution that effectively addresses those issues
