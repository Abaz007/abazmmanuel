                <p class="bottom-spacing">Quarky represents a specialized non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace exclusively designed for the trade of interactive three-dimensional (3D) collectibles, aptly referred to as 'Quarkies.' This innovative platform introduces a novel NFT gallery application that harnesses augmented reality (AR) technology to seamlessly bridge the physical and virtual realms, thereby enabling immersive interactions with your NFT assets.</p>

                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to develop an iOS application capable of displaying two NFTs stored within an Ethereum wallet, with the added functionality of seamlessly integrating and showcasing these NFTs within an augmented reality environment via the Quarky Application.

                <p>
                    In this project, I assumed the role of UX Designer, dedicating my efforts exclusively to crafting the minimum viable product (MVP) for the app. I maintained a close working relationship with the CEO, who also served as the Project Manager, and collaborated closely with developers to ensure the seamless implementation of our solution

                <span class="span-sub-heading">Getting Started</span>
                <p class="bottom-spacing">
                    At the outset, I conducted a series of comprehensive meetings with the Project Manager to gain a deeper understanding of the project's scope. Our strategy revolved around developing a functional prototype that incorporated critical and pivotal features, which would subsequently undergo rigorous testing by actual users.

                <p class="bottom-spacing">Some of the functionalities that were to be included in the MVP were;</p>

                <ul class="bottom-spacing">
                    <li>
                        MVP should connect to an ethereum wallet with two NFTs that contain metadata on 3D image file location
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MVP should demonstrate gallery view of the ethereum wallet that lists the NFTs in the wallet, and individual detail view of the two NFTs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MVP should leverage spatial recognition and geolocation recognition technology to overlay the augmented reality objects on top of real physical places using front and rear cameras
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MVP should enable access to the mocked NFT collectibles and be able to place them into the augmented reality spaces and lock the augmented reality objects within some environment even if the user moves and changes her positions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MVP should enable users to take photos with the collectibles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MVP should demonstrate that we can leverage 'Content Address' and 'Geolocation Coordinates' to pin an NFT collectible to a specific location around the globe.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>After discussing the functionalitites in depth, we were also able to arrange them in a menu. So we had;</p>

                    This project served as a significant learning experience for me within the WEB3 domain. Despite encountering multiple constraints, including time limitations and certain assumptions, I successfully completed the MVP design, incorporating all the previously discussed features.
                    The subsequent phase would have entailed a comprehensive series of user testing. Regrettably, my contract concluded at this point, and the responsibility for this phase transitioned to the internal team
