                <p class="bottom-spacing">Safe Haven Bank is a Digital Microfinance Bank. Before now it existed as a micro finance bank whose operations was centered around cash deposits,withdrawal and issuing small loans to businesses. Because of the regulations set forth by the Central Bank regarding card issuance, which mandate that any fintech company issuing cards must do so through a service bank possessing a card issuing license, Safe Haven was acquired by a fintech firm specializing in programmable card issuance.</p>
    
                <p>Following the bank's acquisition, there was a necessity to realign and reconfigure the bank's infrastructure in order to align it with the intended objectives of the acquisition. This is the rationale behind the redesign of Safe Haven.</p>

                <span class="span-heading">The Problem</span>
                <p>
                    At the time of Safe Haven's acquisition, the organization was dependent on third-party software for its internal operations and adhered to a traditional banking model wherein customers were required to conduct transactions in person at the bank's physical counters. However, this operational model was incompatible with the bank's new strategic direction, necessitating a comprehensive system overhaul.

                    To design an internet banking system (Web and Mobile Experience) for Safe Haven customers such as would replace the traditional operational model.

                    To begin, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the bank's entire operational framework. This encompassed a thorough examination of transaction processes, internal record management, and related operational facets. The insights gleaned from this investigation formed the cornerstone of my discoveries.

                    The previous model consisted of a single-page website(screenshots shown above) primarily featuring a loan calculator as its central functionality, alongside the bank's contact information.
                    I then proceeded to conduct a cursory examination of the historical usage patterns of the old website, revealing its primary purposeâ€”to establish a basic online presence for the bank. It became apparent that most banking operations were traditionally conducted in-person at the physical banking hall by customers.

                <p>Upon completing the initial research phase, the imperative arose to harmonize business requirements with user demands. To accomplish this, I facilitated a strategy session involving all relevant stakeholders. During this session, I shared crucial user-oriented insights while also delving into the realm of business requirements. Due to the constraints imposed by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, I am unable to disclose specific details of the discussion's outcomes as relating to the business. Nevertheless, the strategy session had better informed us as a team of key areas to prioritise and some of the areas are:

                    I encountered series of challenges both externally and internally while working on this project some of them were;

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Compliance and regulations: The financial sector is heavily regulated. While working on this project, I attended series of meetings on financial policies which were changing almost weekly thus affecting some process flows. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Constraints of Time and Resources: I would have loved to conduct some rigorous testing at different phases of the design process and would have impacted the design
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Creative Freedom: My creative freedom was a bit limited because I had to work with what was available and some of my perspective although very much nice and appreciated were put to hold    
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
